Open beta is now released! We've also decided to go fully open source — because we're better together! 🎉

You can play the game at [play.zeiw.me](https://play.zeiw.me), or by downloading the Windows client from our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/h7NxqBe).
Feel free to report bugs or submit feature requests to our [issues-only repository](https://github.com/ZEIW/ZEIW)! 🐛

Thanks for being a part of our community! ❤️

Stay tuned for any updates!
