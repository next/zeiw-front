## About

Pong: A two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

ZEIW is obviously inspired by Pong, with the main difference of being online â€” featuring social integrations
of many kinds! Join the matchmaking queue to randomly be assigned an opponent, or host a party to compete
against your friends. Also choose one of three factions and compete against other factions during events!
